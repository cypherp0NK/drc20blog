In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies, Litecoin emerged as a prominent player, offering a fast and transparent proof of ledger like it’s Gold predecessor. Following a series of upgrades made to the Litecoin network, the LTC20 standard was born for users and developers to broaden the use case of the cryptocurrency.

## **What is LTC20?**

LTC20 is a token standard on the Litecoin blockchain that is designed to enable the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications. The LTC20 standard was first introduced in August 2018 as a proposal to the Litecoin community. It was designed to provide a standardized way for developers to create tokens on the Litecoin blockchain, similar to the ERC20 standard on Ethereum.

## **The technology behind LTC20**

LTC20 is built on top of the Litecoin blockchain, which is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network that allows for fast, secure, and low cost transactions. The Litecoin network is based on the same technology as bitcoin but with a different hashing algorithm called Scrypt. The Scrypt algorithm is a password-based key derivation function originally developed for the Tarsnap online backup service. It is designed to be more memory intensive than other hashing algorithms. Litecoin has been using this algorithm since its birth to maintain secured resistance to attacks while allowing for more transactions to be added to a single Litecoin block.

## **How is the LTC20 standard made possible**

While Litecoin doesn’t natively support smart contracts, developers can still create smart contracts on Litecoin using what is called delegrated proof-of-work (**DPoW**). DPow enables the Litecoin network to verify and execute smart contracts by outsourcing the computation to other blockchains that do support smart contracts, such as Ethereum. By doing this, Litecoin benefits from the functionality of smart contracts without having to build it natively.

## **Creating LTC20 Tokens: A Step-by-Step Guide**

Creating LTC20 tokens on Litecoin is a relatively straightforward process that can be done using a number of different tools and platforms. One popular option is the Litecoin Omni Layer, which provides a user-friendly interface for creating and managing LTC20 tokens. It has a lightweight version called OmniLite which is specially designed for mobile devices and low-powered hardware. To create LTC20 tokens with OmniLite:

- Visit [https://omnilite.org](https://omnilite.org) and click on download.

- Once downloaded, open the application and begin the installation process. OmniLite will open up automatically afterwards.
- Inside the application, you will be asked to choose a data directory. Use the default directory or a custom one for this.
- The application will begin syncing your wallet. Once complete, go to the “Receive” tab to create a new wallet. The input fields are optional so. You can fill the wallet input fields with information such as a wallet label or leave them blank like I have done.

- Click on “Request payment” to see your wallet address.

- Send some Litecoin to your new wallet. Litecoin will be used for gas fees when creating your token. Multiple wallets with OmniLite and they will be displayed under “Requested payments history”.
- Once you have some Litecoin in your wallet, click on “Window” then “console” to open the OmniLite terminal.

- Inside the terminal, you will need to use the `omni_sendissuancefixed` command and other datasets for your token to be created. The datasets are:

  **1. Your wallet address** (E.g “MGZh7KmXC28c9SUw9jk42wcdeEWxtSUJB7”): This will be used to broadcast the transactions to the network.

  **2. Preferred network environment** (mainnet/testnet): This is represented by either 1 for mainnet or 2 for testnet.

  **3. Divisibility/Indivisibility**: If you want your tokens to be indivisible this dataset must be set to 1. Divisible tokens can be created by giving 2 to the dataset. When your token is divisible, fractions such as 0.1 of your token can be sent and received.

  **4. Identifier**: This uses a number (E.g, 0) to identify your token.

  **5. Category**: Defines a category for your token (E.g, “Token”). You can leave this dataset blank but you have to provide an empty parenthesis like so `""`.

  **6. Subcategory**: Defines a subcategory for your token (E.g, “DeFi”). You can leave this dataset blank if you want.

  **7. Token name**: Your token’s name goes into this dataset.

  **8. Website URL**: Token website URL. You can leave this blank if you want.

  **9. Description**: Additional information about your token and its usecase. You can leave this dataset blank.

  **10. Supply**: Circulating supply of your new token.

  (omni_sendissuancefixed "MGZh7KmXC28c9SUw9jk42wcdeEWxtSUJB7" 1 1 0 "Token" "DeFi" "myToken" "https://" "description" "1000000")

Click on the Enter key and that's it. You now have a live LTC20 token! You can view your new token by navigating to the Balances tab.

## **Sending and Receiving LTC20 tokens**

The OmniLite wallet has 2 special tabs for sending and receiving LTC20 tokens. To send tokens navigate to the “Send” tab, select a wallet address to send from, paste the receiving address, and type in an amount of LTC20 tokens to send to the receiving address. Click on send and token transfer will commence. A transaction hash will be returned to you after validators on the network have confirmed that the transaction is legitimate (I.e you sent a correct amount not higher than your balance).

To receive LTC20 tokens you have to share your wallet address with another user. Navigate to the "Receive” tab or go to Window/receiving addresses to get your wallet address.

## **Conclusion**

The adoption of LTC20 tokens opens up new avenues for innovation and creativity in the Blockchain space. Whether you’re looking to incentivize users to participate in your ecosystem, or create new use cases for the Litecoin network, the LTC20 standard provides the tools, resources, and community you need to take your project one step further to its roadmap goals.
