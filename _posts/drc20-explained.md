Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency originally inspired by a popular internet meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog. The cryptocurrency was created in 2013 by software developers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, and quickly gained a following among enthusiasts due to its hilarious nature. The cryptocurrency has been taken more seriously over the years and has amassed a market capitalization of over 9 billion USD at the time of writing this article. The cryptocurrency has never been known to support custom tokens on its network, however, with the introduction of BRC20 on Bitcoin, and LTC20 on Litecoin, Dogecoin has followed suit with its own token standard support for a new DRC20 token.
In this article, we’ll explore the nature of DRC20 tokens and guide you on how to mint and deploy one.

## **What is DRC20?**

DRC20 is a new standard on the Dogecoin blockchain used to create custom and fungible tokens via inscription into units of elons. Elons are small units of Dogecoin’s native currency “DOGE”. They are similar to wei on Ethereum and satoshis on Bitcoin. The DRC20 standard paves the way for its community to become more innovative by creating tokens that can be used in voting systems, blockchain DApps and more.

## **Benefits and Features of DRC20 for Dogecoin**

The groundbreaking move of DRC20 has opened doors to a multitude of benefits and features that propel Dogecoin’s journey to new feats by giving its blockchain:

1. Additional use cases for Dogecoin
2. Simplified Token Creation
3. Community Development
4. Ecosystem Expansion
